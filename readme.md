### About Me
I make discord bots\
I hate making discord bots

I work mostly with Python and as you probably noticed, I mostly make Discord Bots. I'm currently at the University of Lincoln studying a BSc in Computer Science! Don't expect too much here as i'm still getting to grips with GitHub and actually posting code that i'm not ashamed of (i.e. one repo)

### Current Projects
- [**Cutlery Bot**](https://github.com/BSpoones/Cutlery-Bot)
- TheKBot2 - Private repo sorry
### Future Plans
- [ ] **Cutlery bot** Complete rewrite
